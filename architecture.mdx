# Architecture Overview

The Qubit Foundation employs a comprehensive six-layer architecture designed to handle the full lifecycle of energy data - from ingestion and processing to optimization and user interaction. Each layer builds upon the previous, creating a robust, scalable infrastructure for the energy transition.

## Deployment Models

The Qubit Foundation architecture supports multiple deployment patterns:

### Cloud-Native
- Full stack deployment on AWS, GCP, or Azure
- Auto-scaling and managed services
- Global edge deployment for low latency

### Hybrid
- Critical components on-premises
- Non-critical processing in the cloud
- Data sovereignty compliance

### Edge-First
- Local processing for real-time requirements
- Minimal cloud dependencies
- Offline operation capabilities

### Community
- Distributed deployment across participants
- Shared infrastructure costs
- Collective ownership model

## Integration Patterns

<Warning>
The Qubit Foundation is designed for **production energy systems**. Always follow proper safety protocols and testing procedures when integrating with live grid infrastructure.
</Warning>

Common integration approaches:

1. **Schema-First**: Start with standardized data models
2. **Connector-Based**: Use protocol-specific adapters
3. **API-Driven**: RESTful and GraphQL interfaces
4. **Event-Streaming**: Real-time data pipelines
5. **Batch Processing**: Historical data analysis

## Performance Characteristics

The architecture is designed to handle:

- **Throughput**: 10M+ messages per second per node
- **Latency**: Sub-millisecond for critical operations
- **Scale**: Billions of connected devices
- **Availability**: 99.99% uptime with automatic failover
- **Storage**: Exabyte-scale time-series data

## Security Model

<Tip>
All Qubit Foundation components implement **zero-trust security** by default, with end-to-end encryption and cryptographic verification at every layer.
</Tip>

Security is built into every layer:

- **Layer 1**: Device authentication, data encryption, schema validation
- **Layer 2**: Model integrity verification, secure computation
- **Layer 3**: Optimization result verification, tamper-proof algorithms
- **Layer 4**: Byzantine fault tolerance, cryptographic consensus
- **Layer 5**: Smart contract audits, economic security mechanisms
- **Layer 6**: OAuth 2.0, API rate limiting, user privacy controls
