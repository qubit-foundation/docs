## Research Areas

Current research includes:

- **Zero-knowledge proof systems** for privacy-preserving settlements
- **Multi-chain interoperability** for cross-platform transactions  
- **Cryptographic verification** of energy generation and consumption
- **Decentralized identity** for energy prosumers and assets

## Integration Points

Layer 5 will provide settlement for:
- **Layer 4**: Coordinated energy transactions and services
- **Layer 6**: User-facing payment and billing interfaces  
- **External systems**: Traditional utility billing and regulatory compliance
