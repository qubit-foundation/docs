## Architecture Preview

The optimization engine will feature:

- **Mixed-integer programming** solvers for complex scheduling
- **Convex optimization** for real-time control
- **Multi-objective optimization** balancing cost, emissions, and reliability
- **Distributed optimization** for large-scale coordination

## Integration Points

Layer 3 will work closely with:
- **Layer 2**: Using forecasts as optimization inputs
- **Layer 4**: Coordinating solutions across multiple actors
- **Layer 1**: Implementing optimal control decisions
